🧵 Kizilay Shelter Systems: Embroidery Optimization & Predictive AnalysisThis repository contains a specialized R-based statistical framework developed for Kizilay Shelter Systems. It analyzes industrial embroidery machine data to optimize production speed, minimize error rates, and forecast manufacturing timelines using advanced regression techniques.🚀 Technical OverviewThe core of this project is to find the optimal operating point for manufacturing. It doesn't just describe what happened; it predicts the best way to run the machines.1. Polynomial OptimizationThe script utilizes Quadratic Polynomial Regression ($y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2$) to identify the vertex of efficiency curves:Optimal Machine Speed: Finding the speed that minimizes unit production time.Error Minimization: Analyzing the "U-curve" relationship between machine speed and the frequency of errors (thread breaks, needle snaps, etc.).Batch Size Optimization: Determining the ideal number of fabric units to process simultaneously.2. Predictive ModelingA Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is implemented to forecast production outcomes based on:Predictors: Fabric count, machine speed, worker count, embroidery type, and historical error data.Intervals: The model provides 95% Prediction Intervals, allowing management to see not just the "expected" time, but the statistical range of production duration.3. Quality & Comparative AnalysisANOVA: Statistical significance testing of production variables.Workforce Analysis: Comparative Boxplots to evaluate how worker count influences unit time and error distribution.Error Aggregation: Calculation of a composite "Error Score" from multiple failure modes.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: RData Processing: readxl, openxlsx, writexlStatistical Analysis: stats (lm, poly, anova), qcc (Quality Control Charts)Visualization: Base R graphics (Polynomial fits, Boxplots, Residual Analysis)📊 Key ResultsOptimization: Automates the detection of the "Minimum Point" for unit time.Validation: Includes code for checking model assumptions (Residual analysis, Histograms).Forecasting: Generates a 15-unit production forecast based on average machine performance and specific embroidery types (e.g., "Kırmızı Arma").🚀 How to RunClone: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kizilay-embroidery-opt.gitPath: Ensure your data is located at C:/kizilay/data/nakis_verileri.xlsx (or modify the path in the script).Dependencies:Rinstall.packages(c("readxl", "openxlsx", "writexl", "qcc"))
